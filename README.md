# US_LaborStatistics_-governmentsite_WebScraping_Assignment
This was a webscraping assignment where I ethically retrieved information from the US Department of Labor Statistics and performed data analysis.

## The assignment:

1.	Go to https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_python.htm, try to understand the sample code to retrieve BLS data series using API Version 1.

You may find the format of SeriesID here https://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm#CE
Based on the SeriesID definitions, retrieve the following data:

Seasonally adjusted (Seasonal Adjustment code) Average weekly earnings of all employees (Data type code) of Manufacturing, financial activities and Professional and business services (Super Sector Code) from Year 1980 to 2018 from this section.

 
Organize them in the same dataset. Examine the trend of earnings using a graph and explain your findings.

2.	Download “Player_Attributes.csv” from eLearning. Check the number of unique values of the two IDs “player_fifa_api_id” and “player_api_id”. It turns out that the two numbers do not match. What does this mean? Write a program to find the id combinations where “player_api_id” has multiple matches of “player_fifa_api_id”.
